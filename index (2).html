			<p><b>My hobby is music, I really like music, it makes me feel good,<br>
			
			Happy, and sad, I also like the puns and rhymes, in the beat of the song, for me music is life,<br>
			
				It's listening to the singer's story and connecting with him through the music.<br>
				
				My favorite rapper is Notorious B.I.G., he is an American rapper<br>
				
				I have been listening to his songs since I was 14 years old and to this day,<br>
				
				in my opinion, he is the best rapper because of all his stories and what he has been through,<br>
				
				and the ability to improvise and rhyme straight from the head.<b><p>
